# How To Install EOS Node

We strongly recommend you to have Docker installed on your computer and have a latest `eosio/eos-dev` Docker image downloaded on your computer.

If you're not familiar with Docker - it is a container management service used by developers to easily develop applications, ship them into containers which can then be deployed anywhere.

To install Docker please follow this guide: `https://docs.docker.com/install/`

After you download Docker, please open your Terminal and type:
`docker pull eosio/eos-dev`
If you get a permission error, you may need to run `sudo docker pull eosio/eos-dev`

After a download (the image is about 2.8Gb in size) you will be ready.
